                    I am a developer because I didn't want to stop learning.
                    <br /> I loved to be a designer, but I constantly desired to
                    convert my vision into an actual user experience. That
                    thirst led me to step out of my comfort zone. Demystifying
                    the programming was never easy, but when I finally built a
                    website with full javascript features on my own â€” when
                    several lines of code brought life to my draft, I realised
                    that coding was the better half that I was looking for.
