                    I am a developer because I didn't want to stop learning.{" "}
                    <br />
                    <br />I loved to be a designer, but some part of me felt
                    like design is only half of it; I constantly desired to
                    convert my vision into an actual user experience. That
                    thirst led me to step out of my comfort zone.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Demystifying the programming wasn't easy; The endless
                    question of 'Why this is not working?' or 'Why this is
                    working?', getting used to the ugly monospaced fonts..
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But when I built the first website with full javascript
                    features on my own — when those several code lines brought
                    life to my draft — I realised that coding was the better
                    half that I was looking for. I never stopped coding since
                    then.
