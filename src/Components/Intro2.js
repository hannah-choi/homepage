                    I'm JavaScript developer with 4 years of design experience.{" "}
                    <br />
                    <br /> Mostly I write code in Javascript and use React,
                    NodeJS, MySQL. <br />I also love working on Linux web server
                    and database as much as I do the front-end side. <br />
                    <br />
                    I design apps with reusability & user-driven approach in
                    mind. <br />
                    Currently I'm stretching myself, teaching myself JavaScript
                    Algorithms and data structure to go deeper.
